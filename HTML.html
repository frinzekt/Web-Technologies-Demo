					<h4 class="">What is it?</h4>

					<p>
						HTML is a standard markup language for documents to be displayed in web browser. It serves as
						the layout of the document's
						content in a web browser by using what's called Document Object Model (DOM) Tree
					</p>

					<h4 class="">History</h4>
					<div>
						<h5 class="">1991-1993: Basic Creation (HTML 1.0)</h5>
						<p>
							Tim Berners Lee created the HTML in the late 1991, and released HTML 1.0 in 1993. This is
							created to share information that
							is readable and accessible via web browsers
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5 class="">1994-1995: Official Release of HTML (HTML 2.0)</h5>
						<p>
							Official publication of HTML as HTML 2.0 which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along
							with additional features. HTML
							became the official standard markup language for designing and creating websites, and
							refined various core features of HTML which made
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5 class="">1995-1997: CSS Introduction and LOTS OF CONFLICTED GOALS (HTML 3.0)</h5>
						<p>
							HTML 3.0 publication is a huge conflict. Many parties wanted
							different features, and implemented those features which became a problem as there is no
							single standard. A HTML document could look different in different browsers. Even though
							HTML 3.0 was rejected multiple times, there was an agreed upon list of implemented features
							at the end of the 1997:
							<ul>
								<li>Content NOT Presentation Markup
									<p>Establishment of HTML as a structural/content markup rather than to make "things
										pretty". This is supported by the need of platform independence (support for
										different screen sizes, devices, presentation formats). This was particularly
										difficult as presentation is most of the time linked to expression of
										intention/message. </p>
								</li>
								<li>Support for Cascading Style Sheets
									The key takeaway here is that there needs to be a way to express design without
									incorporating with structure.</p>
						</li>
						<li>Support for Non-Visual Media
							<p>Inline figures are polished especially with the use of table markups</p>
						</li>
						<li>Support for Different Ways Of Creating HTML
							<p>There was an introduction of creating HTML with a variety of tools such as word
								processing format or other SGML application. This is interesting as it is possible to
								design a basic website in word processor such as Microsoft Word as an export. What You
								See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) feature is an important piece for reaching more user of
								HTML as it is very straightforward</p>
						</li>
						</ul>
						</>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5 class="">1988-1999: More removal of Presentational Tags, Object Multimedia, and Smart
							Forms(HTML 4.01)</h5>
						<p>Basic CSS has been introduced in order to separate some of the presentational layer from HTML
							as well as trimming some of the old tags such as:

							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;ISINDEX&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;APPLET&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;CENTER&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;FONT&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;BASEFONT&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;S&gt;</span></<span>. Most of these are replaced with their css
							counterparts, as the tag name suggest, these are old html tags that gives presentation.
							Also, multimedia object are replaced to be more general with
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;OBJECT&gt;</span>
						</p>
						<p>See more <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/appendix/changes.html">here</a></p>
						<p>Moreover, there some new tags that were added such as :
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;Q&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;ACRONYM&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;INS&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;DEL&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;COLGROUP&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;FIELDSET&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;LABEL&gt;</span>
							<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;BUTTON&gt;</span> . Most of these complements the existing tags
							specifically the "phrasal" (blockquote, strong, code, em) s and the form/input tags.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5 class="">2012 - Today: (HTML 5.0)</h5>
						<p>One of the biggest change for the web technology as a whole. HTML5 is the integration of
							several different technology (CSS, JavaScript, and server-based technologies) so this update
							made it easier to update or integrate with the other technologies
							<ul>
								<li>Semantic markup: New tags that describe parts of a document such as<span
										class="hljs-tag">&lt;NAV&gt;</span>, <span
										class="hljs-tag">&lt;ARTICLE&gt;</span>, <span
										class="hljs-tag">&lt;SECTION&gt;</span>, <span
										class="hljs-tag">&lt;HEADER&gt;</span>, and <span
										class="hljs-tag">&lt;FOOTER&gt;</span>.</li>

								<li>New form elements: HTML5 forms have some major updates. There are several new
									versions of the <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;INPUT&gt;</span> element, allowing users
									to pick colors, numbers, e-mail addresses, and dates with easy-to-use elements.</li>

								<li>Media elements: HTML5 has native support for audio and video with tags similar to
									the <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;IMG&gt;</span> tag.</li>

								<li>canvas tag:This allows creation of object and interface elements that are useful for
									gaming, charts and visualizations.
								</li>
							</ul>

				<div id="DOM">
					<h4>Document Object Model</h4>
					<p>The document object model is the structure written in HTML. HTML integrates the web technology
						using the DOM by allowing CSS to bind and decorate using selectors, and allows JavaScript to use
						the DOM API for manipulation.</p>
					<p>This project has a live HTML Dom Viewer. Either click the one on the navigation bar, or click <a
							class="" href="#" onclick="$('#menu-toggle').trigger('click')">here</a></p>
				</div>
				<div id="ImportantFeatures">
					<h4>Most Important Tags Of HTML</h4>
					<p>These are the most important features of HTML that will be seen in most websites to follow</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Meta Tags</p>
							<p>These tags are very useful for SEO (search engine optimisation) as it will help
								webcrawlers
								in finding the site content. There is only two meta tags used in this website to specify
								the
								content size (to properly shift to mobile) and character content.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Division Tags</p>
							<p>These tags are probably the most important tag as it determines the main structure of the
								DOM. This has many names such as
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;DIV&gt;</span>
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;NAV&gt;</span>, <span
									class="hljs-tag">&lt;ARTICLE&gt;</span>, <span
									class="hljs-tag">&lt;SECTION&gt;</span>, <span
									class="hljs-tag">&lt;HEADER&gt;</span>,
								and <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;FOOTER&gt;</span>, but their difference of use is only
								for
								semantic.</p>
						</li>

						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Anchor Tags</p>
							<p>This tags facilitates linkage towards other websites or sections. Take the navbar for
								example, and <a href="#history">this</a> that takes you to the HTML history</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Form Tags</p>
							<p>Most websites will have some sort of input system such as a contact form, search, or
								login which makes these types of tags essential. Check the <a
									href="/JavaScript.html#ajax-demo">JS Demo</a></p>
							<p>There are a lot of form tags a few of them are
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;input&gt;</span>,
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;textarea&gt;</span>,
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;button&gt;</span>,
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;select&gt;</span>,
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;option&gt;</span>,
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;optgroup&gt;</span>,
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;fieldset&gt;</span>,
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;label&gt;</span>,
								<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;output&gt;</span>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Script and Stylesheet Linking Tags</p>
							<p>These tags are used in order to integrate CSS and JavaScript to HTML. such as</p>
							<pre><code class="hljs">
							&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" /&gt;

							&lt;script src="dist/bundle.js"/&gt;
							</code></pre>
