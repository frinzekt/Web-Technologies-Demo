				<div>
					<h4>Brief History & Features</h4>
					<p>Taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh6lK57Cuk4">here</a></p>
					<p>Browser needed to be dynamic and interactive so it was modelled around the language Java</p>
					<h5>1994: Mocha</h5>
					<p>First JavaScript, but not called JavaScript and a syntax like JAva, but contained most of the
						features used today such as:
						<ul>
							<li>First Class Functions</li>
							<li>Dynamic Typing</li>
							<li>Prototypal Inheritance</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h5>Early 1995: LiveScript -> Late 1995: JavaScript To 1996: JScript??</h5>
					<p>Beta release of JavaScript was released around 1995. In 1996, Microsoft created Internet Explorer
						(IE) and JScript which is identical to JavaScript</p>
					<h5>1997: ECMAScript 2</h5>
					<p>Due to the growing number of JavaScript, and different scripting language using different. There
						was a need to standardize what a standard scripting language should be and have so ECMAScript is
						born, but is missing a lot of features to what it has today</p>
					<h5>1999: ES3</h5>
					<p>New Features are implemented such as: <ul>
							<li>Error Handling</li>
							<li>Strict Equal Operator "==="</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h5>2000: Rebel Microsoft, AJAX, ES3.1 (Rejection of ES4)</h5>
					<p>IE controlled most of the market share, Microsoft implemented many JavaScript extension without a
						care with ECMASCRIPT because of this, web developers have a hard time developing a website that
						works the same in all browser</p>
					<h5>2006: jQuery</h5>
					<p>One of the first JS library that works more reliable with by transpiling into JavaScript
						supported by independent browser. Hence, fixing most of the browser support problem </p>
					<h5>2008: Chrome and V8 Engine-> 2009: Node</h5>
					<p>JavaScript became viable to be compiled and interpreted. Hence allowing possibility in high
						performance computing and server-side. In 2009, nodejs was introduced built in V8 as a
						server-side runtime running an event-loop to run event-driven non-blocking code (asynchronous)
					</p>
					<p>This made JavaScript one of the languages that can be used in a complete stack (the JS Everywhere
						paradigm) </p>

					<h5>2009: ES5</h5>
					<p>Introduced a lot of awesome features such as: <ul>
							<li>JSON Support</li>
							<li>Functional Array and Object Method</li>
							<li>Accessors (OOPD-like)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h5>2010: JS Frameworks and CoffeeScript </h5>
					<p>
						Frameworks are created to solve the problem of keeping the UI in sync with the state as well as
						allowing modularity in HTML (division through components). CoffeeScript is the
						initial/"fire-starter" for transpiling (important in ES6)
					</p>
					<h5>2015: ES2015 / ES6</h5>
					<p>Introduced more features for JavaScript to introduce more readable code, uniformity with other
						languages, and asynchronous such as:
						<ul>
							<li>let and const</li>
							<li>Promises</li>
							<li>Arrow functions</li>
							<li>Classes</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>A problem though is that these features are not natively supported in old browsers. Hence,
						transpilers were important to convert new code to old code that is supported in all browsers</p>

				<!-- WHAT JAVASCRIPT IS -->
				<div>
					<h4>What Is JavaScript in the Web?</h4>
					<p>
						JavaScript is the programming language that drives the interactivity of content in the web by
						using DOM manipulation which can extends to producing dynamic content for the web.

					</p>
				</div>
				<!-- AJAX -->
				<div>
					<h4>Asynchonous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)</h4>
					<p>
						AJAX is the dream of any web developer, to be able to fetch data without the need of refreshing
						the page. AJAX is a method
						most often used with API sources serving data usually in the form of Javascript Object Notation
						(JSON) in order to fetch data.
						This data could be anything, a response error, a payload or even HTML and CSS (most common for
						Single-page Applications).
						Unlike a usual web HTTP request, AJAX is not only limited to GET request, it can also perform
						POST request that can contain an
						request body that can be used for sending data to the server. There multiple "fake" HTML request
						that are supported in the
						browser, such as PUT and DELETE, but only GET and POST are supported by HTML. See W3C HTML 5.0
						spec.

					<!-- AJAX DEMO -->
					<h5>Spotify Song Demo: AJAX and DOM Manipulation</h5>
					<p>Search the album or related singles you want to listen to down below.</p>
					<form onsubmit="searchSongs(event)">
						<div class="input-group">
							<input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Search Album" name="search" />
							<div class="input-group-btn">
								<button class="btn btn-default" type="submit">
									<i class="fas fa-search"></i>
								</button>
							</div>
						</div>
					</form>
					<div id="ajax-demo" class="row"></div>
					<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
						<div class="loader" style="display: none;"></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br />
				<!-- EXPLANATION -->
				<div>
					<h5>How It Works</h5>
					<p>
						Firstly, this web application will request authorization to access data. This specific web
						application is communicating with a
						<a class="link" href="https://spotify-token-authenticator.frinzelapuz.now.sh/">node server built
							by me</a> that contains the
						secret keys in order to contact spotify server. The spotify server will respond to the node
						server, then respond with an
						authentication that is stored as a variable here.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the acquisition of authorization token, this web application will contact the spotify
						server as well as providing the
						token. The spotify server will respond with the data specified in the endpoint. In this case, it
						will access the 3 Endpoints:
						"search", "album" and "song" endpoints.
					</p>
					<p>
						After acquiring all the data from the endpoints, it is packaged into a smaller object variable,
						and passed into functions that
						will manipulate the DOM (add, remove songs)
					</p>
					<p>Something very interesting happens when you load songs. Take a look at the developer tools, under
						the network tab.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, some songs don't have preview url, in order to display as demo.</p>
